# RPG Character Equipment Management System üéÆüõ°Ô∏è‚öîÔ∏è

## Overview

The RPG Character Equipment Management System is a lightweight and efficient system designed to help players create and manage characters, equip/unequip weapons and armor, and calculate combat power dynamically.

This project is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and follows SOLID principles and design patterns to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

## Features

- Character Management ‚Äì Create and manage Warrior and Mage characters
- Equipment Management ‚Äì Equip and unequip weapons/armor with enforced limits
- Combat Power Calculation ‚Äì Dynamic formula-based combat power updates
- User-Friendly Interface ‚Äì Simple CLI-based UI for seamless interaction
- Scalability ‚Äì Easy expansion for new character classes, equipment types, and game mechanics

## OOP Pillars

### Encapsulation

    ‚Ä¢ Private fields (_name, _attackPower, _defensePower) in Weapon.js, Armor.js, and Character. js ensure that properties cannot be directly modified from outside the class.
    ‚Ä¢ Getter methods (e.g., get name(), get attackPower()) expose necessary information without breaking encapsulation.
    ‚Ä¢ Bad Example:
        class BadWeapon {
            constructor(name, attackPower) {
                this.name = name;
                this.attackPower = attackPower; // ‚ùå Public field (bad practice)
            }
        }

### Abstraction

    ‚Ä¢ The Character.js class is abstract and cannot be instantiated directly, enforcing that all character instances must be of a derived type like Mage or Warrior.
    ‚Ä¢ CombatPowerCalculator.js abstracts the combat power calculation logic.
    ‚Ä¢ Bad Example:
        const brokenCharacter = new Character("Unnamed", "Unknown"); // ‚ùå Should not be possible

### Inheritance

    ‚Ä¢ Mage.js and Warrior.js extend Character.js, inheriting properties and behaviors while modifying the combat power calculation for their specific needs.
    ‚Ä¢ Bad Example:
        If Mage.js and Warrior.js did not extend Character.js, they would duplicate the same logic instead of inheriting:
            class Mage {
                constructor(name) {
                    this.name = name;
                    this.type = "Mage";
                    this.equippedWeapons = [];
                }
            }

### Polymorphism

    ‚Ä¢ calculateCombatPower() is overridden in Mage.js and Warrior.js, implementing different power calculations based on the class type.
    ‚Ä¢ Bad Example:
        If a subclass does not override calculateCombatPower(), it may cause errors:
            class Warrior extends Character {
                constructor(name) {
                    super(name, "Warrior");
                }
                // ‚ùå Missing calculateCombatPower() override
            }

## SOLID Principles Applied

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

    ‚Ä¢	Character.js handles character properties.
    ‚Ä¢	Weapon.js and Armor.js define equipment.
    ‚Ä¢	CombatPowerCalculator.js calculates combat power separately.

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

    ‚Ä¢	The Character class can be extended with new character types (Mage, Warrior) without modifying its base class.
    ‚Ä¢	CombatPowerCalculator.js delegates calculation to character-specific implementations, making it open for extension but closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

    ‚Ä¢	Mage.js and Warrior.js can be used interchangeably where Character.js is expected without breaking functionality.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

    ‚Ä¢	Character.js enforces specific capabilities without forcing all characters to implement unnecessary methods. Mages and Warriors only define what they need.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

    ‚Ä¢	CombatPowerCalculator.js depends on the abstract Character class rather than concrete subclasses, allowing flexibility and reusability.

## Design Patterns in My Code

    ‚Ä¢ Factory Pattern - (CharacterFactory.js)
    ‚Ä¢ Strategy Pattern - (CombatPowerCalculator.js)
    ‚Ä¢ Singleton Pattern - (EquipmentManager.js)

## AI Usage:

    ‚Ä¢ User Persona, the prompt that I gave ChatGPT 4o is Casual player, hardcore gamer which has knowledge of game design, and the master player of RPG game. I think the response AI gave me makes sense because it covers players from different dimensions logically.    
    ‚Ä¢ I ask ChatGPT 4o to summarize the key points in Problem Statement, and the prompt is the entire Problem Statement, and the summary is precise.
    ‚Ä¢ I ask ChatGPT 4o to help me implement the Business Requirement in case that I miss something. The prompt is the Business Requirement that I wrote. It did help me add something about     Scalability and Rules & Constraints which are both significant to RPG Games. 
    ‚Ä¢ I used ChatGPT4o to assist in writing JSDoc documentation. The prompt that I use is all my classes with attributes and method that I defined in UML diagram.
    ‚Ä¢ I also talked to ChatGPT 4o a lot to discuss whether some of my ideas were logical or not.
